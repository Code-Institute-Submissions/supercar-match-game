<h3>Hello and welcome to my 'Readme', the Readme will give you lot's of information about the game that I have constructed.</h3><br>

<p>The game has been constructed for my Code Institute Frontend Development milestone project.</p><br>

<h2>UX.</h2><br>

<p>I built a supercar memory game at first with a choice of 10 cars and 20 windows with a grescale backgroud and gave the game to my friends and family for feedback.</p><br>

<p><strong>Feedback received was.</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Not enough cars.</li>
<li>Too easy.</li>
<li>The greyscale background is not very easy on the eyes.</li>
<li>Possibly need '?' rather than 'Click Me' messages.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>
So the feedback was taken onboard and changes were made.
</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>20 cars now added with 5 spares to change appearance of game in the future.</li>
<li>Windows now change colour when clicked upon once from green to yellow to throw concentration.</li>
<li>The greyscale background is now green and yellow with '?'.</li>
</ol>


<h2>WIREFRAMES.</h2>


















<h2>FEATURES.</h2>

<ol>
<li>The memory game consists of 40 windows with 20 supercar pair images hidden.</li>
<li>The object of the game is to click two windows to try and match a supercar pair.</li>
<li>Once a window has been clicked an image appears and waits until a second window is clicked.</li>
<li>If the images match they stay open.</li>
<li>If the images do not match there is an interval timer of 2 seconds that will return the windows to the '?' mark background.</li>
<li>Messages will be displayed once certain actions have been applied.</li>
</ol>

<h3>ie.</h3>

<ul>
<li>"Click any window".</li>
<li>"Sorry No Match have another go".</li>
<li>"Match Found. Your Doing Great click for more supercars".</li>
<li>"Congratulations You have won Click begin to start new game".</li>
</ul>
